				<h3>Why Project Management is Essential</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>The planning of a project can be a time-consuming and costly process.</li>
						<li>The cost of a poorly planned and miss-managed project will be more evident if the original objectives are not realized.</li>
						<li>If a project fails, costs will have been incurred for which there are no benefits.</li>
						<li>Statistics show that more than half of all IT projects are considered to have failed.</li>
						<li>The formation of a Project Team and the appointment of a Business Sponsor are of primary importance to ensure the successful implementation of any Business Systems Project.</li>
					</ul>
