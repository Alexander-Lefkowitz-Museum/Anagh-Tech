			<h3><span>We Believe<span></h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Modern organizations struggle with staffing challenges stemming from increased knowledge work, labor shortages, competition for applicants, and workforce diversity.</li>
				<li>In any situation, the optimal staffing solution produces the correct number of qualified workers for the job in the most cost-effective manner. Getting the job done should be the paramount consideration in any staffing strategy.</li>
				<li>Even the most elegantly designed staffing strategy will fail if line managers do not continuously see results.</li>
				<li>Negotiating with a staffing firm is not strictly a price-and-terms deal that you take or walk away from.</li>
				<li>Because the staffing firm will be an integral part of your corporate culture for a long time, and will play a significant role in helping meet your business objectives, it should be viewed as a partner, not an adversary.   </li>
				<li>By better understanding the business and operations of staffing firms, the Human Resources department of a company can more effectively fine tune the negotiating strategy to obtain the lowest feasible cost. </li>
